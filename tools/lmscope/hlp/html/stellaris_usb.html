<h1>USB Host and Device Operation</h1>
<p>
The qs-scope application can operate either as a USB host or as a device with the mode being selected from the <a href="stellaris_setup.html">Setup</a> control group.</p><h2>USB Device</h2>In
USB device mode, the qs-scope application configures the EK board to
allow connection to a USB host. A packet-based, application-specific
protocol is defined to allow communication with an application on the
host system. The LMScope Windows application implements this protocol
and uses it to remotely control the qs-scope application and receive
waveform data from it for display on the host system.<br><br>By default, the qs-scope application configures the USB controller for device-mode operation.<h2>USB Host</h2>In
USB host mode, the qs-scope application acts as a host system
supporting USB Mass Storage Class (MSC) devices. This allows
MSC-compliant USB storage such as flash sticks to be connected to the
board and accessed from the application.<br>In this mode, the EK board
is responsible for providing power to the attached USB device assuming that the device is not self-powered. To support host
operation, the board must be powered either by an external 5V DC power
supply or via the "Debug USB" port connected to a PC.<br><br>
