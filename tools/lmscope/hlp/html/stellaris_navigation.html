<h1>Navigating The Menu System</h1>
<p>All qs-scope controls and settings are accessed using
the&nbsp;multi-direction switch labelled "NAVIGATE" on the
EK-LM3S3748&nbsp; board.&nbsp; This control offers up, down, left,
right
and select functions in a single unit.&nbsp; Rocking the control in the
desired direction sends ``up'', ``down'', ``left'' or ``right''
messages to the application and pressing on the center sends a
``select'' message.</p><p>Controls and settings are arranged into groups by function such as <a href="stellaris_display.html">display settings</a>, <a href="triggering.html">trigger settings</a>, <a href="stellaris_files.html">file operations</a> and <a href="stellaris_setup.html">setup choices</a>.&nbsp;
These groups are accessed by pressing ``select'' to display the main
menu.&nbsp; With the menu displayed, use ``up'' and ``down'' to select
between the available groups of controls.&nbsp; When the desired group is
highlighted, press ``select'' once again to dismiss the menu.</p><p>Controls
from the currently selected group are shown in the bottom portion of
the application display.&nbsp; Use ``up'' and ``down'' to cycle through
the controls in the group and ``left'' and ``right'' to change the
value of, or select the action associated with, the control which is
currently displayed. </p><p>For example, to set the oscilloscope to trigger on a rising edge, the following actions would be performed:</p><ol><li>Press "select" to show the qs-scope main menu.</li><li>Press "up" or "down" until &nbsp;the "Trigger" option is selected.</li><li>Press "select" to dismiss the menu display.</li><li>Press "up" or "down" until the "Trigger" control is displayed.</li><li>Press "left" or "right" until&nbsp;trigger type "Rising" is displayed.</li></ol>Obviously, if the trigger control group was already selected, the first three steps of this example would not be necessary.
