<h1>Building the LMScope application</h1><br>The LMScope Windows<sup>®</sup>
application was created using Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Visual Studio<sup>®</sup> 2005. It is
written in C++ and uses Microsoft Foundation Classes. The source code
is provided and can be built using the lmscope.vcproj file which is
included.<br><br>One additional component must be installed on your&nbsp;PC to allow the application to be built. Microsoft HTML
Help Workshop 1.4 is used to generate the LMScope help file
(lmscope.chm) from HTML topic files. This tool is available for free
download from Microsoft at:<br><br><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms669985.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms669985.aspx</a><br><br>Depending
upon the version of VisualStudio you are using and the updates you have
applied, you may also need to download and install the latest version
of the Windows Platform SDK. At the time of writing, this was version
6.1 which can be installed from:<br><br><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=E6E1C3DF-A74F-4207-8586-711EBE331CDC&displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=E6E1C3DF-A74F-4207-8586-711EBE331CDC&amp;displaylang=en</a><br><br>LMScope
communicates to the USB device via the LMUSBDLL library which is
installed as part of the device driver for the oscilloscope device.
This library acts as a thin wrapper over the WinUSB API which is used
to manage and communicate with the device at the lower level. The main
purpose of the library is to allow the LMScope and usb_bulk_examples to
be modified and rebuilt on systems which do not have the Microsoft
Windows Device Driver Kit installed (as required to allow access to the
WinUSB library and header files).<br><h2>Building the LMUSBDLL.dll Library</h2>The
LMUSBDLL.dll file is provided as part of the device driver installer
for both the oscilloscope and bulk example devices. The Windows example
package includes the source for the DLL to allow it to be modified if
required.<br>LMUSBDLL
uses the WinUSB interface to communicate with the Stellaris EK board. This interface is available
on WindowsXP and Vista but the bindings for it are not available in
Visual Studio 2005 and are not redistributable outside the Windows
Device Driver Kit (DDK). To build the DLL, therefore,&nbsp;DDK version 6000
must be installed on your PC in directory C:\WinDDK\6000. If you have
the DDK installed elsewhere, you will have to change the "Additional
Include Directories" under Project/Properties/ConfigurationProperties
and "Additional Library Directories" under
Project/Properties/ConfigurationProperties/Linker to substitute the
appropriate paths for your system.<br><br>The Windows DDK is available for free download from Microsoft at:<br><br><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/ddk/default.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/ddk/default.mspx</a>
