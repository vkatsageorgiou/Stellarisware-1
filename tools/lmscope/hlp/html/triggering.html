Triggering Notes</h2>
Trigger detection is performed in software during the Analog-to-Digital
Converter (ADC) interrupt service routine. At the highest capture rate
(1MSample/second), the ADC FIFO will overflow in 8µS if not serviced so
time in the ISR is obiously a precious commodity. To ensure correct
operation at all capture rates, therefore, a simple edge detection
algorithm is
used which merely checks every second sample to determine whether the
signal is rising or falling. This works well with typical signals but
can result in false triggers in very noisy cases.<br>
<br>
The qs-scope application defaults to "Always" trigger mode in which
edge detection is not performed and the oscilloscope merely returns all
samples captured from the point that a waveform is requested. This is a
useful mode to allow the trigger level to be adjusted prior to setting
the trigger edge. At the highest capture rates, the ADC interrupt
handler uses the vast majority of the CPU while performing trigger
event detection and, as a result, the user interface will not be
serviced while trigger detection is occurring. To prevent
this, qs-scope uses a high priority interrupt on the push buttons to
signal to the data acquisition module that the current capture should
be aborted whenever a button is pressed. This allows the user to set
the trigger level and type successfully at all capture rates and also
allows the user to cancel a One Shot trigger request where the trigger
event is never detected (for example, if the trigger level is set to a
voltage that never occurs in the measured signal).<br>
<br>
This
abort mechanism is not available when remotely controlling qs-scope via
USB. If qs-scope is waiting for a trigger, the user may have to press
the EK board buttons to abort the capture request in this case since
the USB interrupt is deliberately set at a lower priority than the ADC
interrupt (to prevent the USB handling from preempting the more time
critical ADC operation). Note that this is only the case when capturing
at the highest supported rate. At lower capture rates, there is
sufficient time for USB and the user interface to be serviced at the
same time as an ongoing waveform capture.<br>
