USB Serial Device

This example application turns the evaluation kit into a virtual serial
port when connected to the USB host system.  The application supports the
USB Communication Device Class, Abstract Control Model to redirect UART0
traffic to and from the USB host system.  File usb_dev_serial_win2k.inf may
be used to install the example as a virtual COM port on a Windows2000
system.  For WindowsXP or Vista, usb_dev_serial.inf should be used.
